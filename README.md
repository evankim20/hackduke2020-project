HackDuke2020 Code For Good Project: Education Track
Goal: With so much free content on youtube, it often the primary resource to learn new skills. However, there is so much content that first-time learners sometimes find it hard to discern what content and channels are worth their limited time. We created a platform which ranks youtube videos based on user ratings, sentiment analysis, and channel/video metrics. Users can rank their favorite youtubers similar to rate my professor.

## Tech Stack

Back-End: Django, SQLite
